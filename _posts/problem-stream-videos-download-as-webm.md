Problem: Stream videos download as .webm

To open a WebM file in Adobe Premiere Pro, you should convert it to a format like MP4, MOV, or ProRes as these are generally well-supported by the software and can import without issues; converting to MP4 is often the most straightforward option.

WebM is not natively supported:
Adobe Premiere Pro doesn't directly support WebM files, so conversion is necessary. 


To convert a WebM file to MP4 using VLC Media Player, you can: 

Download and install VLC Media Player
Open VLC Media Player
Select Convert/Save from the File menu
Click Open media and select the WebM file to convert
Choose the Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4) profile
Click Save as File
Click Browse to choose a destination folder and file name
Click Save to start the conversion
