# Audacity Editing for Beginners: 16 Tips in 9 Minutes

When organizing personal video editing projects in Adobe Premiere Pro, it’s best to keep your folder structure separate from where Adobe Premiere Pro is installed. This helps with easy access, better organization, and ease of backup. Here’s a suggested folder structure to keep things neat:

Recommended Folder Structure:
	1.	Main Projects Folder (Create in your Documents or another dedicated drive for easy access)
	•	[Project Name] (This folder is created for each editing project)
	•	01_Raw Footage (Store all original video files here, including screen recordings and raw footage)
	•	02_Assets (Store additional media like music, sound effects, graphics, images, or overlays)
	•	Audio (for music tracks, sound effects, voiceover files)
	•	Graphics (for logos, lower thirds, or any other visual assets)
	•	Images (for still images or thumbnails)
	•	03_Adobe Premiere Pro Project Files (Store your Premiere Pro project file here)
	•	04_Exports (Store final exported videos here, ready for upload)
	•	YouTube (for finalized videos you will upload to YouTube, organized by resolution, date, or topic)
	•	05_References (Any documents, scripts, or notes related to your editing process, like a list of filler words or pauses to cut out)

Documents
└── Video Projects
    └── MyProject
        ├── 01_Raw Footage
        ├── 02_Assets
        │   ├── Audio
        │   ├── Graphics
        │   └── Images
        ├── 03_Adobe Premiere Pro Project Files
        ├── 04_Exports
        │   └── YouTube
        └── 05_References

Why this structure works:
	•	Separation of concerns: Keeping assets, raw footage, and exports in separate folders makes it easy to navigate and ensures you don’t mix up the original files with the final product.
	•	Efficiency: By placing the project in your Documents or a dedicated external drive, you allow for better organization and easier backups. Storing it where Adobe Premiere Pro is installed might lead to unnecessary clutter and difficulty finding your files.
	•	Future-proofing: This structure also works well for larger projects or if you need to share files with collaborators.
