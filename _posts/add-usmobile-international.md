The process of adding a US Mobile international plan to my Pixel 6 was slightly different than their instructions.
Here's how I did it for an upcoming trip.

## Requirements
1. US Mobile cellphone plan
3. An eSIM-compatible phone
4. A phone with an internet connection
5. A phone that can scan QR codes

## Purchase
[Add instructions here.]

## Install
These instructions were tested on a Pixel 6 running Android 13.

1. Print out confirmation email with QR code or open email in a laptop or other phone.

### On your Pixel 6

2. Go to Settings > Network & Internet
3. Tap the plus (+) sign next to SIMS
4. On the "Connect to mobile network" screen, tap "Download a SIM instead"
5. Tap Next
6. On the "Confirm your network" screen, tap "+ Use a different network"
7. On the "Scan QR code from network" screen, take a picture of the QR code in your confirmation email.
8. Select download
   (The plan is called "Connect")
9. Once installed, you can rename it to your destination, ie: "Mexico."

## Once you arrive at your destination
1. Go to Settings > Network & Internet
2. Tap on SIMs
3. Select your international eSIM line
4. Turn on your eSIM line and it will activate automatically
5. Turn on Data Roaming.
6. Then tap on Access Point Names
7. Select Internet and update the APN field with *internet*

This can take up to five minutes.
if you experience longer wait times or other issues, please refer to their [troubleshooting guide]().

## Important things to know

### Please do not remove your eSIM

Do not delete or remove your eSIM after you have installed it until you are done using it and do not need it anymore.
Your QR code can only be scanned once. If you need another QR code, please reach out to our support team.
Each eSIM can only be installed once.

### Keep a record of your activation info
USMobile suggests taking a screenshot of the QR, activation and APN codes they email you with your activation info (in case you have trouble getting connected).

### Access the US Mobile app offline

These guides are also available offline through the US Mobile app, so you'll be able to access all of this information whenever you need.

### This plan may support multiple carriers

Depending on when and where you travel, US Mobile will automatically select the best carrier. See full list of supported carriers here.
